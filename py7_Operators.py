#Types of Operator

	#Arithmetic Operators
		# + - * / % ** //
		
		#a + b = 31
		#a – b = -11
		#a * b = 210
		#b / a = 2.1
		#b % a = 1
		#a**b =10 to the power 20
		#9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0
		
		# // Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity):
		
	#Comparison (Relational) Operators
		#	== !=	>	<	>=	<=
	
	#Assignment Operators
		#	=	+=	-=	*=	/=	%=	**=	//=
	
	#Logical Operators
		
		#and or not
	
	#Bitwise Operators
	
		#a = 0011 1100

		#b = 0000 1101

		#-----------------

		#a&b = 0000 1100

		#a|b = 0011 1101

		#a^b = 0011 0001

		#~a = 1100 0011
